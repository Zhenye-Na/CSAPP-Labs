This is the handout directory for the CS:APP Cache Lab. 

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim

Check the correctness and performance of your transpose functions:
    linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 32
    linux> ./test-trans -M 64 -N 64
    linux> ./test-trans -M 61 -N 67

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructor runs):
    linux> ./driver.py
