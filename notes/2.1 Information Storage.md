# Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.1 Information Storage

- The product of a set of positive numbers will always be positive, although overflow will yield the special value to $+\infty$.  
- Floating-point arithmetic is not associative due to the finite precision of the representation.


> **The role of pointers in C**
> 
> They provide the mechanism for referencing elements of data structures including arrays. Pointers has two aspects: *value* and *type*. The value indicates the location of some object,


### 2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation

One simple trick for doing the conversion in your head is to memorize the decimal equivalents of hex digits A, C, and F. Then the hex values B, D, and E can be translated to decimal by computing their values relative to the first three.


### 2.1.2 Data Sizes

Every computer has a *word size*, indicatipg the nominal size of pointer data. Since a *virtual address* is encoded by such a word, the most important system parameter determined by the word size is the _maximum size of the virtual address space_. That is, for a machine with a w-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range from 0 to $2^w - 1$, giving the program access to at most $2^w$ bytes.

- Integer data can be either *signed*, able to represent negative; zero, and positive values, or *unsigned*, only allowing nonnegative values. 
- Data type `char` represents a single byte. Although the name char derives from the fact that it is used to store a single character in a text string, it can also be used to store integer values

Data types `short`, `int`, and `long` are intended-to provide a range of sizes. Even when compiled for 64-bit systems, data type int is usually just 4 bytes. Data type long commonly has 4 bytes in 32-bit programs and 8 bytes in 64-bit programs.



### 2.1.3 Addressing and Byte Ordering

- The former convention - where the *least significant byte comes first* is referred to as `little-endian`.
- The latter convention - where the *most significant byte comes first* is referred to as `big-endian`.

Suppose the variable `x` of type int and at address `0x100` has a hexadecimal value of `0x01234567`. The ordering of the bytes within the address range `0x100` through `0x103` depends on the type of machine:

### 2.1.4 Representing Strings

A string in C is encoded by an array of characters terminated by the `null` (having value O) character. Each character is represented by some standard encoding, with the most common being the ASCII character code. Thus, if we run our routine show _bytes with arguments "12345" and 6 (to include the terminating character), we get the result `3132 33 34 35 00`

> **A fundamental concept of computer systems is that a program, from the perspective of the machine, is simplfa sequence of bytes.**

### 2.1.7 Bit-Level Operations in C

C supports bitwise Boolean operations. In fact, the symbols we have used for the Boolean operations are exactly those used by C: `|` for `OR`, `&` for `AND`, `~` for `NOT`, and `^` for `EXCLUSIVE-OR`.


### 2.1.8 Logical Operations in C

C also provides a set of *logical operators* `||`, `&&`, and `!`, which correspond to the `OR`, `AND`, and `NOT` operations of logic.


### 2.1.9  Shift Operations in C

In contrast to C, Java has a precise definition of how right shifts should be performed. The expression `x >> k` shifts x arithmetically by k positions, while `x >>> k` shifts it logically.

For unsinged data, right shifts must be logical.
Mostly using logical shift when singed data.

> The shift amount is computed as k mod w.
